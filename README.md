#Impressive

This is a fork of [Impressive](http://impressive.sourceforge.net/) by Martin Fiedler, which is a great lightweight presentation tool that seems to no longer be under active development. My goal in this fork is to incorporate dual monitor support, influenced by [a fork available on Github](https://github.com/geekq/impressive), and to trim the program of features I don't need (highlighting and slide transitions).

It's also a chance for me to finally put that python I've been learning into practice.

Another application that looks promising is [Pdf-Presenter-Console](https://github.com/jakobwesthoff/Pdf-Presenter-Console).
